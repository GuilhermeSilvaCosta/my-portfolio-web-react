I would like to say something about “Code Skills / Design Skills”… Don't give relevance to the values ​​and technologies presented, my experience forces me to say that relating skill percentage to a technology does not make much sense. Whenever I use or study a certain technology, I realize that I know less and less about it, and I need to go deeper… So how could I say that I know 100% of a technology? Why did I study 100% of your documentation? But would it make sense for me to say that I have 100% skill in a technology, but never put it into practice in any product? Or if I applied to a product, was I successful? These are questions that only numbers played will not answer…",
